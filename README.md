## **Project Description**

> ### It's a simple, useful and fun little `Meal Delivery App` with features like load meals from API carousels to show the list of popular and Recommended meals, new Meal creation Form and overall a beautiful design that showcase the business.

> Deliver Delicious a moderately interactive webapp where I try to show my JavaScript, react, redux and CSS skillsset by creating a miniature vertion of it.
>
> I have used React for leveraging it's easy to reason about API to build smooth and fluid UI.
>
> I have also used Redux Not context API for state management as I have to fetch meal data from API and fetching data with useEffect, then set that data to state and finally inject that to context is not that much great in my opinion and also redux has some great benefit for managing complex Client side data.
>
> For handling Form (validation and stuff like that) I used React-hook-form. It's so helpful that I don't have to write another custom hook.
>
> For Styling I used styled-components as It has many benefits e.g. don't have to think className, can write JavaScript etc. The Project is completely responsive as well.

## **While building, I try to focus on**

- makes simple & Elegant looking design
- Used Technology such as, React, Redux, Styled Components, React Hook form & React Icons
- Fully Responsive Design
- Clean Code and Independent (meaning component is Re-usable)
